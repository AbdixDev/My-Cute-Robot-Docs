# Welcomer (Example)
Let's see how our cute robot can welcome the newcomers in the server

## Goal
To welcome the new users in a channel #welcome
by sending message:
```
Welcome @user to our cute server
```

only that? no, let's also give him role @member
## Steps
1. Send `-create` in the server, and name the sketch `Welcomer` (it can be anything)

2. Which Starter we will use?\
Obviously [`User Join`](../starters/memberJoin.md) starter

3. Now, what will be our first step?, let's send the message by choosing: `Message` then `Send`

4. Select the channel where to send (#welcome), then let's tell the bot what is the message

**Note**: we used a placeholder of `member` provided by the starter

5. then let's add our 2nd step, which for adding the role, select `Role` then `Give`
