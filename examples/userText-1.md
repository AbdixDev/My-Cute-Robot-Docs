## Steps
1- Send `-create` in the server, and name the sketch `Cute Hugger` (it can be anything)\

2- Which Starter will we use?\
It will be [`User Say Something`](../starters/userText.md) starter \

3- It will ask us to start when user send what text? Let's send `hug`\

4- It will ask for which matching type?\
in this situation, we want this starter to start when a message starts with `hug`. so let's select `Starts with`\

5- Now, case sensitivity? let's make him case insensitive, so it accept `Hug, HUG, hUg` as well

6- Okay starter is done, time to add the sketch's [steps](../steps/)\
1st step will be [send message](../message/sendmessage.md)

7- Which channel? well, bot random gif should be sent in the same channel as the starter\

8- What is the message content? we will use the [placeholder](../tutorials/placeholder.md) to get the user mention, and whatever he mentioned inside the message through the [starter placeholders](../starters/userText.md): [`message`](../placeholders/message.md), [`member`](../placeholders/member.md)\
Let's send: 
```
<member> hugs <message mentions>

```
9- Save!

i will just hug me ðŸ˜¢

11- It worked! but... that's not random, it will always send same gif, next part we will just add an extra step to give random gif, we will re-do the previous steps from 1 to 5 but instead of adding `send message` as step 1 we will select [`random text`](../steps/randomtext.md)

12- Random Input, requires us to input each text separated by `;`+`new line (enter)`\
Let's enter the gif links

13- Then add next step to be [`send message`](../steps/sendmessage.md), channel as `starter channel` but on content it will appear a menu\
we will select `custom`\

14- then it will ask for custom content, let's send:
```
<member> hugs <message mentions>
<randomtext1>
```
> Take note of <randomtext1> this [placeholder](../tutorials/placeholder.md) is provided by the [random text step](../steps/randomtext.md) we added in step 11
